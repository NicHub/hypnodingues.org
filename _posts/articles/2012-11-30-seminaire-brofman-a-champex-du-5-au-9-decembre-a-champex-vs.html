<p>Our next Healing Intensive (Level 1) in Switzerland will take place December<br />
5 to 9, 2012 at the Hotel Sunways, in Champex, in the beautiful Swiss Alps.</p>
<p>This powerful experience of the Body Mirror System of Healing will be<br />
presented in English by its creator, Martin Brofman, with simultaneous<br />
translation into French. If you are not yet familiar with the Body Mirror<br />
System, information can be found on our website at <a href="http://www.healer.ch/">http://www.healer.ch</a>.</p>
<p>If you speak no French it is not a problem, since most of the people who<br />
attend also speak English. It will be easy to find people to work with, and<br />
to socialize with.</p>
<p>This system of healing developed by Martin Brofman, PhD,<br />
is a synthesis of Western psychology and Eastern philosophies based on the<br />
chakras (energy centers found in the Hindu traditions).</p>
<p>Because each of these chakras can be associated with certain parts of the<br />
consciousness as well as certain parts of the body, they allow us to read<br />
the body as a map of the consciousness within.</p>
<p>Thus, tensions in the body are seen to reflect tensions in the<br />
consciousness, and the chakras can be used as avehicle to understand the<br />
Body Mind Interface and its implications for healing.</p>
<p>During the class, you will exchange six healings with other participants,<br />
using various techniques you have been taught, and at the completion of the<br />
class, you will be able to:<br />
1. Understand and experience yourself as a Being of energy.<br />
2. Feel and direct energy, and see energy (auras, chakras, thought forms.)<br />
3. Understand the relationship between your body and your consciousness.<br />
4. Understand how symptoms in the body reflect tensions in the consciousness.<br />
5. Read the body as a map of consciousness, understanding the inner causes<br />
to outer symptoms.<br />
6. Understand the chakras and their associations with specific parts of<br />
the consciousness and specific parts of the body.<br />
7. Use various tools designed for healing (White Light, colors, thought<br />
forms.)<br />
8. See the results of putting these techniques and tools to use.</p>
<p>Tuition for this class will be FS 600 or 500 euros if you are<br />
participating for the first time. If you have already articipated in at<br />
least one Level 1 Healing Intensive with any instructor, anywhere in the<br />
world, you are eligible for a 50% reduction in the tuition, and if your card<br />
